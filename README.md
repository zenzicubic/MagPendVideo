# MagPendVideo

This repo contains the code for my magnetic pendulum video. It's written in various languages, but mainly C# and Javascript.

# The folders

The folder ```evolving_fractals``` contains the code used to make the animations of pendulums with time evolving. It's written entirely in C#, with ```System.Drawing``` used to make the images.

The folder ```diverging_pendulums``` contains the code used to make the animations of pendulums separating and diverging into chaos. It's made in JS.
